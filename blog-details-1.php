                <h5 class="mt-3">Royal Rajputana</h5>
                <p>Embrace the grandeur of Rajasthan’s royal heritage with a wedding set in a majestic palace or fort. Think of elaborate decor, traditional Rajput attire, and grand processions. Venues like the City Palace in Udaipur or the Mehrangarh Fort in Jodhpur offer an unparalleled royal experience.</p>

                <h5 class="mt-3">Heritage Haveli</h5>
                <p>Celebrate your special day in a historic haveli, rich with architectural splendour and cultural history. These venues provide an intimate yet luxurious setting, perfect for creating a deeply personal and memorable event.</p>

                <h5 class="mt-3">Beach Bliss</h5>
                <p>For a more relaxed yet luxurious celebration, consider a beachfront wedding in Goa or Kerala. Imagine exchanging vows with the backdrop of the setting sun and the soothing sound of waves. Luxury resorts in these regions offer private beaches and bespoke services to ensure a flawless event.</p>

                <h5 class="mt-3">Palatial Grandeur</h5>
                <p>India’s palaces, such as the Taj Lake Palace in Udaipur or the Rambagh Palace in Jaipur, are epitomes of luxury. These venues provide a fairy-tale setting with their lavish interiors, exquisite gardens, and unparalleled service.</p>

                <h5 class="mt-3">Modern Fusion</h5>
                <p>Combine the best of traditional and contemporary elements for a unique wedding theme. This could mean blending traditional ceremonies with modern decor or serving gourmet Indian cuisine with a contemporary twist.</p>

                <h5 class="mt-3">Exquisite Venues and Locations</h5>

Indian wedding planners like Wedniksha and The Wedding Design Company are known for their expertise in creating bespoke luxury weddings. They handle everything from venue selection and decor to guest management and entertainment, ensuring a stress-free and unforgettable experience.</p>

                <h5 class="mt-3">High-End Catering and Gourmet Experiences</h5>
                <p>Indian cuisine is celebrated for its rich flavours and diversity. For a luxury wedding, caterers like Foodlink and Creative Cuisines India offer gourmet experiences that elevate traditional dishes with modern presentations. Signature cocktails and mocktails infused with Indian flavours add an extra touch of sophistication. Additionally, consider having a mithai (Indian sweets) bar, offering beautifully crafted traditional sweets.</p>

                <h5 class="mt-3">Designer Wedding Attire and Accessories</h5>
                <p>In 2024, bridal couture trends include elaborate lehengas and sarees from designers like Sabyasachi Mukherjee and Manish Malhotra. Grooms can opt for bespoke sherwanis and bandhgalas. Accessorise with luxury jewellery from brands like Tanishq and Amrapali to complete the look.</p>

                <h5 class="mt-3">Extravagant Decor and Floral Arrangements</h5>
                <p>The extravagant decor sets the tone for a luxury wedding. Trending floral designs feature exotic blooms and intricate mandaps. Decor inspirations draw from India’s rich cultural heritage, with opulent tablescapes, grand chandeliers, and bespoke furniture. Personalised elements such as custom monograms and unique details that reflect the couple’s story add a special touch.</p>

                <h5 class="mt-3">Entertainment and Guest Experience</h5>
                <p>Entertainment is a key aspect of a luxury wedding. Hire renowned Indian artists and performers to create memorable experiences. Interactive experiences like traditional dance performances, live painters, and photo booths enhance guest engagement. Thoughtful guest gifts, reflecting Indian craftsmanship, leave a lasting impression.</p>

                <h5 class="mt-3">Conclusion</h5>
